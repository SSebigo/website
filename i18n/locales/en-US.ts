        For LaForge Powerlifting in Montpellier, I worked with the co-founder in the creation of a coaching platform that would allow the gym's coaches and their athletes to have a more advanced coaching solution than simple Excel sheets. \n
        The platform is divided into two parts: a web application for coaches offering them an ergonomic solution to create and manage their athletes' programs, but also their coaching packages and subscriptions. The second part is a mobile application for athletes, offering them an ergonomic interface to carry out their sessions and follow the progress of their programs, but also to manage their subscriptions. \n
        As lead dev on this project, the first step of this project was to study the different technologies available. Thus, I created a few mockups in Flutter, Svelte (SvelteKit) and Vue (Nuxt). In terms of performance, Flutter was clearly the winner for mobile applications, but for web applications, the performance left something to be desired. I chose Vue for the web application because the technology is more mature than Svelte and allows me to do some things that, unfortunately, are not available with Svelte or too unstable. \n
        Working on this project only part-time (two days a week), we launched a closed beta to a few LaForge coaches and athletes in September. The feedback is numerous and the development of the platform has resumed in full swing thanks in particular to the numerous feedbacks of features that the coaches (more than athletes) would like to see implemented.

        For Evarisk, I joined a team of three developers in the development of modules for Dolibarr. \n

        This experience was an opportunity for me to try my hand at PHP, which is a language that I have always struggled with, not in terms of difficulty, but in terms of syntax. \n
        I thank the Evarisk team, but also Eoxia, for their welcome and wish them a future full of success.

  exatech: {
    position: 'Flutter developer',
    description: `
        For Exatech, I joined the company as a Flutter developer. In fact, I joined the company because they were looking for someone with experience in Flutter, because this technology was new to the internal teams, and it turns out that at that time I had almost two years of personal projects behind me. \n
        Exatech is a company in the educational sector that develops solutions for administering, managing and correcting exams. During my time at Exatech, I worked on a new solution that aimed to be able to administer, manage and correct exams in a single platform. \n
        So, at first, I had almost free rein to take the existing code base and modify it as I saw fit, to end up with something more solid to continue developing the application. \n
        The first year was a bit chaotic, because we had to fight almost constantly with the fact that the web version of Flutter was still in alpha at the time and that many features were unstable or simply non-existent. \n
        Once the stable version of Flutter web was available, things were much simpler and the development of the platform accelerated, because most of our problems had been solved just like that. \n
        I have very good memories of Exatech and I thank the team for trusting my judgment, especially in a phase as complicated as starting a project. The app was released a little after I left Exatech and seems to be quite successful. Congratulations to all.

    description: `
        For AIRDDM, I joined the development team in Montpellier as part of my end-of-year internship at Epitech. \n
        AIRDDM is a company that develops and maintains digital platforms on behalf of third parties. During my time there, I worked on a site belonging to Bosch. \n
        My experience at AIRDDM took place in two stages. \n
        First, I was assigned to redesign the statistics pages on behalf of Bosch. Indeed, the site in its original version took up to ten minutes to display a few graphs. My task was therefore to rewrite these pages with Vue, to take advantage of its asynchronicity. \n
        The second part of this experience was a little shorter than the first and also more theoretical. Indeed, I had to explore several models to integrate a chatbot into the Bosch site. The only criterion was that it be open source. Thus, my attention was focused on a chatbot developed by SNCF whose code was up to date, but not the documentation. So I took the last month at AIRDDM to update the chatbot documentation and make a proof of concept integration. \n
        This experience was my first experience as a pure front-end developer (although I was able to work from time to time on the back-end side to help colleagues). \n
        I thank the AIRDDM team for having confidence in my decisions and I wish them good luck.

        For Witco, which at the time this experience took place was called MonBuilding, I joined the company as part of my third-year internship at Epitech. \n
        At the time, Witco was a company that developed a platform that allowed all the stakeholders in a building to be connected. \n
        This experience is directly related to my learning of web technologies, particularly Node.js. I was lucky enough to be able to work as a fullstack developer, although the front end of what I was asked to do was only used by members of the company. \n
        My tasks during this experience consisted of developing the company's back office. Thus, I developed various interfaces for interacting with databases (creation, deletion, modification), but also the development of interfaces for monitoring the activity of these databases. \n
        This experience was a first for me, because it was the first time I ventured out of Montpellier to go to Paris. \n
        I thank the Witco team for welcoming me and supporting me in learning the different web tools that partly make me the developer I am today.

        Ahhhhhh was the first application I created. Written in just under an hour, it was basically just an exercise in exploring the possibilities offered by Flutter. Ahhhhhh was such a hit with my friends and family that I decided to share it on Google Play Store and publish the code as open source.\n
        It got off to a rocky start after opening to the public, but success finally came after two weeks when a fan in Mexico made a TikTok with it. Today Ahhhhhh has almost reached one million downloads and a score of 4.5/5 with almost 3,000 ratings.\n
        My favourite feature is, and always will be, the ability for users to add their own sounds to the application. It came to me when I ran out of ideas for new sounds in an update.\n
        Ahhhhhh is not available on iOS, because despite my numerous attempts and much to my regret, Apple, after examining the application, considered it useless and therefore inappropriate for the App Store.

  forktale: {
    shortDescription: 'Forktale is a collaborative writing application inspired by l\'Arbre des possibles.',
    description: `
        The basic idea behind ForkTale is inspired by Bernard Werber's Tree of Possibilities: what if it were possible to access an alternative scenario while reading a work? In simple terms, it's about being able to choose an alternative sequel to the story you're reading if you don't like the events of the current story, or if you're simply curious about what might have happened.\n
        The way the application works is quite simple: for writers, it is possible to propose several alternative chapters to their readers, but it is also possible for other writers to intervene in your story to propose their own alternative chapters.\n
        For readers, if you don't like a chapter or if you're curious to know what might have happened if a particular event had occurred or happened differently, you can just go back to the previous chapter and branch off into an alternative sequel.\n
        At the time I developed it, Forktale was the biggest development project I'd ever undertaken on my own. From the design of the application to the design of the database, not forgetting the development itself, optimisation of the Flutter code, DevOps to enable several versions of the application to be deployed and tested, etc.\n
        An official release has never been announced, and the project is on hiatus, but from my point of view, ForkTale is the project that allowed me to learn more about Flutter and mobile app development in general. The project is no longer in active development and I don't currently have any plans to take it over, but it's not out of the question that I might return to it in the future.

  luminagpt: {
    shortDescription: 'LuminaGPT is an AI-assisted worlbuilding application.',
    description: `
        LuminaGPT is really just an exercise I've been doing to try out two things: developing desktop applications in Flutter and understanding how programs like AutoGPT work.\n
        As Flutter is a cross-platform framework, most of the features you have access to when developing for mobile or web are also available for desktop applications. The only bottleneck I encountered was with Firebase, but apparently this is a problem known only to its developers.\n
        To understand how programs like AutoGPT work, it's simpler than it looks. AutoGPT is in fact a loop similar to the one in the image below.\n
        The world building of LuminaGPT is in fact an excuse to have a framework in which to test the capabilities of the LLM model (in this case OpenAI GPT-3.5) to be able to feed itself with tasks.\n
        Apart from the coding aspect, there's also a writing aspect which caused me a little problem, as LLM models need to be guided in their reasoning, so to start the LuminaGPT reasoning loop, the model is fed with the following message ‘You are an autonomous task creation AI for worldbuilding called Lumina Brain.’ to give it the context of what it ‘is’ and then with this message ‘Given the following goal: {goal}, you have to create tasks that will help you reach or more closely reach the goal. Return the response as an array of strings without any explanation or additional text. The response should be usable in JSON.parse().’ to give it the context of what is expected of it and how the result should be presented.\n
        However, given that this is a machine, it often happens that the request is not respected in part or in full. It may be a problem with the message or with the model itself (not ‘intelligent’ enough?).\n
        In any case, LuminaGPT was a very good exercise for me, which allowed me to demystify the workings of AutoGPT, which seemed to me to be almost like magic. The only regret I have about this project is that I didn't have time to implement a vector database in the project to preserve the knowledge of the model.\n
        The project is no longer in active development and there's very little chance of me returning to it.
