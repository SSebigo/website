        Graduated with a Master's degree in Information Technology Expertise from Epitech in 2020, I have had the chance to wear several hats during my relatively short career. Fullstack developer, front-end, back-end, a little design here, some devops there, I've touched a little bit of everything.\n
        Today, I focus on developing personal projects, whether they are web applications, video games or artistic projects.\n
        However, these projects are not currently my main activity. I spend most of my time working on projects for clients, as a freelance developer.\n
        If you have a project in mind, don't hesitate to contact me, I would be happy to help you realize it.

    description: `
        Ahhhhhh was the first application I created. Written in just under an hour, it was basically just an exercise in exploring the possibilities offered by Flutter. Ahhhhhh was such a hit with my friends and family that I decided to share it on Google Play Store and publish the code as open source.\n
        It got off to a rocky start after opening to the public, but success finally came after two weeks when a fan in Mexico made a TikTok with it. Today Ahhhhhh has almost reached one million downloads and a score of 4.5/5 with almost 3,000 ratings.\n
        My favourite feature is, and always will be, the ability for users to add their own sounds to the application. It came to me when I ran out of ideas for new sounds in an update.\n
        Ahhhhhh is not available on iOS, because despite my numerous attempts and much to my regret, Apple, after examining the application, considered it useless and therefore inappropriate for the App Store.

  forktale: {
    shortDescription: 'Forktale is a collaborative writing application inspired by l\'Arbre des possibles.',
    description: `
        The basic idea behind ForkTale is inspired by Bernard Werber's Tree of Possibilities: what if it were possible to access an alternative scenario while reading a work? In simple terms, it's about being able to choose an alternative sequel to the story you're reading if you don't like the events of the current story, or if you're simply curious about what might have happened.\n
        The way the application works is quite simple: for writers, it is possible to propose several alternative chapters to their readers, but it is also possible for other writers to intervene in your story to propose their own alternative chapters.\n
        For readers, if you don't like a chapter or if you're curious to know what might have happened if a particular event had occurred or happened differently, you can just go back to the previous chapter and branch off into an alternative sequel.\n
        At the time I developed it, Forktale was the biggest development project I'd ever undertaken on my own. From the design of the application to the design of the database, not forgetting the development itself, optimisation of the Flutter code, DevOps to enable several versions of the application to be deployed and tested, etc.\n
        An official release has never been announced, and the project is on hiatus, but from my point of view, ForkTale is the project that allowed me to learn more about Flutter and mobile app development in general. The project is no longer in active development and I don't currently have any plans to take it over, but it's not out of the question that I might return to it in the future.

    shortDescription: 'LuminaGPT is an AI-assisted worlbuilding application.',
    description: `
        LuminaGPT is really just an exercise I've been doing to try out two things: developing desktop applications in Flutter and understanding how programs like AutoGPT work.\n
        As Flutter is a cross-platform framework, most of the features you have access to when developing for mobile or web are also available for desktop applications. The only bottleneck I encountered was with Firebase, but apparently this is a problem known only to its developers.\n
        To understand how programs like AutoGPT work, it's simpler than it looks. AutoGPT is in fact a loop similar to the one in the image below.\n
        The world building of LuminaGPT is in fact an excuse to have a framework in which to test the capabilities of the LLM model (in this case OpenAI GPT-3.5) to be able to feed itself with tasks.\n
        Apart from the coding aspect, there's also a writing aspect which caused me a little problem, as LLM models need to be guided in their reasoning, so to start the LuminaGPT reasoning loop, the model is fed with the following message ‘You are an autonomous task creation AI for worldbuilding called Lumina Brain.’ to give it the context of what it ‘is’ and then with this message ‘Given the following goal: {goal}, you have to create tasks that will help you reach or more closely reach the goal. Return the response as an array of strings without any explanation or additional text. The response should be usable in JSON.parse().’ to give it the context of what is expected of it and how the result should be presented.\n
        However, given that this is a machine, it often happens that the request is not respected in part or in full. It may be a problem with the message or with the model itself (not ‘intelligent’ enough?).\n
        In any case, LuminaGPT was a very good exercise for me, which allowed me to demystify the workings of AutoGPT, which seemed to me to be almost like magic. The only regret I have about this project is that I didn't have time to implement a vector database in the project to preserve the knowledge of the model.\n
        The project is no longer in active development and there's very little chance of me returning to it.
